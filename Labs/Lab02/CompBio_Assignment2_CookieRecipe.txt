SALTED BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE CHUNK SHORTBREAD COOKIES from Bon Appetit

STUFF YA USE

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of cold, salted butter cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
6 ounces bittersweet dark chocolate, roughly chopped
1 large egg, beaten to blend
Demerara sugar for rolling
Flaky sea salt

STUFF YA DO

Beat butter, sugars (except Demerara), and vanilla on medium high speed in a mixer until light and fluffy, 3-5 minutes.

With mixer on low, slowly add flour, then chocolate chunks. Beat just to blend.

Divide dough in half and place each half on large sheet of plastic wrap. 

Form the dough in to a log shape around 2 inches in diameter and wrap up with plastic wrap. Set in fridge until firm, 2 hours. 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 

Remove cookie dough logs from the fridge and brush with egg wash. Roll the logs in Demerara sugar. 

Cut logs into 1/2 inch rounds.

Line rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and place rounds on sheets around one inch apart. Sprinkle tops with sea salt. 

Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until edges are just beginning to brown. 

Let cool slightly before devouring and contemplating going to the gym.
