# Emily Beam's GitHub Repository for Computational Biology
This GitHub Repository is my experience taking computational biology as the course happens. This is my space to learn, unlearn, and experiment with coding, git, GitHub, and R. 

In R, I will be focusing on:
* writing my own functions
* for loops
* conditional statements 

In GitHub I will be focusing on: 
* transparency of research methods
* methodology behind collaborative work


We'll see how this goes!
